# rock-paper-scissors

This is a rock, paper, scissors game for TOP's Foundations Course.
Here's the live link!

## What I learned

* Randomly select an item from an array
* Traversing the DOM
* DOM methods, such as query selectors, element creation, and adding inline style and text
* I ran into a problem where my variable remained unaltered after modifying it inside of a function. Since the function wasn't immediately executed due to it being a callback, I moved it inside of the function. This is when I learned more about asynchronicity.
* Pixel art! I used [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) to create the game's graphics. Fonts were bought from [Kenney Game Assets](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets).

## Future Todos

* Make the game responsive
* Ensure accessibility
